# babassu

An in-browser microprocessor simulator, based on the [Samphire](http://www.softwareforeducation.com/sms32v50/index.php) instruction set (which is in turn based on x86). Samphire is used to teach CS1111 at University College, Cork, but it restricted to Windows.

This project aims to recreate as much of the Samphire application as possible using JavaScript.
